            <h3>Directions</h3>

            <li>Prepare marinated fish: Whisk olive oil, vinegar, lime juice, lime zest, garlic, honey, 
                seafood seasoning, hot pepper sauce, cumin, chili powder, and black pepper together in a bowl 
                until blended. Place tilapia in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over the fish; cover the 
                dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours</li>

            <li>Make the dressing: Combine sour cream and adobo sauce in a bowl. Stir in lime juice, lime zest, 
                seafood seasoning, cumin, and chili powder. Add salt and pepper to taste. Cover and refrigerate 
                until needed.</li>

            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Set the grate 4 inches from the 
                heat.</li>

            <li>Remove fish from the marinade, drain off any excess and discard the marinade. Grill fish pieces 
                until easily flaked with a fork, turning once, about 9 minutes.</li>

            <li>Assemble tacos: Place fish pieces in the center of tortillas with desired amounts of tomatoes,
