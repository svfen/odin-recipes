        <h3>About this Recipe</h3>

        <p>Veggie sliders offer a tasty and versatile alternative to traditional 
            meat-based sliders. These small, flavorful burgers are typically made 
            with a variety of plant-based ingredients such as black beans, lentils, 
            quinoa, mushrooms, or chickpeas, mixed with herbs, spices, and breadcrumbs 
            to bind them together. The mixture is formed into patties and cooked until 
            golden brown and crispy, either on a grill, stovetop, or in the oven.</p><br>

        <p>Veggie sliders can be served on mini burger buns or lettuce wraps and topped 
            with an array of delicious accompaniments like avocado, tomato, lettuce, 
            pickles, and a variety of sauces or spreads. They're perfect for vegetarians, 
            vegans, or anyone looking to incorporate more plant-based options into their 
            diet, offering a satisfying and flavorful bite in a smaller, snackable size.</p> <br>
