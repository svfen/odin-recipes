# odin-recipes

This is my first Odin Project in the "Foundations series.

This project, though simple, was time consuming. I wanted to type most of the element tags and the boilerplate out
each time to ensure it became a habit and make sure I understood the basics of everything Odin has taught me so far.
Though it was frustrating at times (I would constantly create files in the wrong directory or forget to add file types),
it was good because it drilled the command line commands into my head on renaming and moving files and directories. 

With more practice, I hope this can all become second nature and that I will instinctly remember each command and action
without constant misteps.
